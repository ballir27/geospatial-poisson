This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
``` 
```{r}
burglaries_2023 <- read_csv("data/burglaries_2023.csv")
census <- read_csv("data/census.csv")
DC = read_sf(dsn = "data/DC", layer = "DC")
```
```{r}
burglaries_2023 %>% head()
census %>% head()
DC %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf()

```

```{r}
burglaries_geo <- st_as_sf(burglaries_2023 %>%  drop_na(latitude),
         coords = c('longitude', 'latitude'),
         crs = st_crs(DC)
         )
```

```{r}
burglaries_tracts <- st_join(burglaries_geo, DC, join = st_within)
burglaries_full <- merge(census, burglaries_tracts, by.x = "tract", by.y = "TRACTCE", all = FALSE)
```

```{r}
incidents_per_tract <- burglaries_full %>%  
  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  group_by(tract) %>% 
  summarize(num_incidents_per_tract = n_distinct(incident_number)) %>%  
  arrange(desc(num_incidents_per_tract))
```

```{r}
tract_pops <- burglaries_full %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  select(c(tract,population)) %>% 
  distinct()
```

```{r}
inner_join(incidents_per_tract,tract_pops, by="tract") %>% 
  mutate(incidents_per_thousand_pop = num_incidents_per_tract/(population/1000)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(incidents_per_thousand_pop)) %>% 
  filter(is.finite(incidents_per_thousand_pop))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
