This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
```
```{r}
res = GET("https://data.nashville.gov/resource/2u6v-ujjs.json?$where=incident_occurred%20%3E%20%272023-01-01T00:00:00%27&$q=BURGLARY&offense_nibrs=220&$limit=5000")
```
```{r}
res
burglaries_2023_FROM_API = fromJSON(rawToChar(res$content))

burglaries_2023_FROM_API %>% tail()

```
```{r}
write.csv(burglaries_2023_FROM_API, "data\\burglaries_2023_FROM_API.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
